            <li><b>Explain how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to facilitate client/server interaction.</b></li>
            <i>HTTP acts like the messenger between the client device and the server device.</i>
            <hr>
            <li><b>What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?</b></li>
            <i>HTTP is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.  HTTPS is the same, but with encryption and verification.</i>
